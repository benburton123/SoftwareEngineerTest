# Software Engineer Test - Ben Burton

I have taken an ATDD approach to solving the problem and incrementally introduced the rules into the solution by first adding the test scenario and then passing the test with its implementation. Once I had built up my regression suite of tests I proceeded to refactor the API so that the logic is encapsulated within rules that can be run in a coherent way. The rules and the order in which they are run are wired up through dependency injection.
